      # Since the OSDs could end up on any node, an effort needs to be made to spread the OSDs
      # across nodes as much as possible. Unfortunately the pod anti-affinity breaks down
      # as soon as you have more than one OSD per node. If you have more OSDs than nodes, K8s may
      # choose to schedule many of them on the same node. What we need is the Pod Topology
      # Spread Constraints, which is alpha in K8s 1.16. This means that a feature gate must be
      # enabled for this feature, and Rook also still needs to add support for this feature.
      # Another approach for a small number of OSDs is to create a separate device set for each
      # zone (or other set of nodes with a common label) so that the OSDs will end up on different
      # nodes. This would require adding nodeAffinity to the placement here.
